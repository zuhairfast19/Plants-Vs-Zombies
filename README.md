Hey there viewer! If you have managed to get into this file, you are indeed eager to see what I have done with the project. The project is aimed at the execution of my Object Oriented Programming concepts in C++ in the best possible manner.
For that, we were assigned to create a Plants Vs Zombie replica, using the resources and the time we had by our side.
My project involved the use of adequate animations and textures to ensure that the game experience is exactly the same as the original one, hence it took a lot of time and effort for the optimal execution.

Features:
-> Sufficient in-game mechanics which include destruction of the onboard projectiles.
-> Dedicated Menu & Scoreboard to inform users about their progress
-> Win/Loss Mechanism included as well
-> Interesting loading screen with a timer attached too.

I will be dropping a video with in my Github repository as well for those who are eager to see it.
